# Nixos sd image and mainline uboot for Odroid N2

> Suitable for a server. Make sure you have your UART.

Kernel patches sourced from the Armbian build.

Built regularily on the nix `release-20.03` branch on `arm64` hardware.

### What's working

- RTC
- Boots from SD, USB, eMMC (tested)
- ethaddr

### What's not working

- Resetting the network adapter (`ip link set eth0 down/up`) requires a reboot!
- WOL
- Linux desktop acceleration (needs panfrost drivers?) (won't fix)

### Not tried

- Audio

### How to prepare a bootable drive.

Running `nix-build` links products under the `./result` folder. You will need to build an image and uboot and write them to a drive to boot.

1. Build an image (on an aarch64 or x86_64 box)

`nix-build release.nix -A sdImage`

Then `dd` it to an sd card (or usb or eMMC)

```
DEV=/dev/mmcblkX
IMG=./result/???/sd-image-odroid-n2.img
dd if=$IMG of=$DEV conv=fsync bs=4M
sync
```

2. Build a u-boot (x86_64 box only :S)

Build the firmware package `fip` that packs u-boot ready for use.

`nix-build release.nix -A fip`

Then `dd` it to the sd card (or usb or eMMC)

```
DEV=/dev/mmcblkX
UBOOT=result/u-boot.bin
dd if=$UBOOT of=$DEV conv=fsync,notrunc bs=512 seek=1
sync
```

## On your first boot

Upon first boot, you will need to setup a `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`. Generate one using `nixos-generate-config`.

Afterwards, refer to the same `profile.nix` that the sd image was built from. This profile contains the board specific kernel package and configuration.

```
{ config, pkgs, lib, ... }:

{
  imports = [
    /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix
    /etc/nixos/nix-odroid-n2/modules/profile.nix
  ];
}
```

## Lessons learnt

- When a cross-compiled image is used. NixOS will be rebuilt on the device natively when doing `nixos-rebuild`.

- Cross-compiling is a means to get something going if you don't have any suitable `arm64` hardware. Use `arm64` hardware when you can.

- When cross-compiling turn off everything you can till you get something that boots. For example, turn off sound, wifi or filesystem drivers.

- You can build an image on `arm64` hardware using `nix` on Armbian. Ensure you enable enough swap space ~15GB and have a 4GB model. This build will be much quicker because you can leverage the `arm64` binary cache.

- Cross-compiling is possible and has been done time to time. It bootstrapped this project. However it is not maintained as `arm64` builds work better. YMMV.
